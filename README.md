# Autonomous Vehicle Risk Management Profile for Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR)

To provide guidance on risk management and in response to the National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Act of 2020, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed the [AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF 1.0)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ai/NIST.AI.100-1.pdf). The Framework, which was released in January of 2023, was developed as a guideline for organizations in all industries to manage risks throughout the AI system lifecycle. 

This [TSR profile][(NIST-AI-RMF-TSR-V-0.0.pdf](https://github.com/um-dsp/NIST-AI-RMF-Traffic-Sign-Recognition-Profile/blob/main/NIST-AI-RMF-TSR-V-0.0.pdf)) is developed based on the NIST AI RMF frameworkâ€™s functions, categories, and subcategories as a comprehensive guideline. It combines NIST AI RMF with extensive research on the associated automated technologies to develop a temporal AI risk management use case profile for TSR. This profile is designed to offer valuable insight into effectively managing risk throughout the AI lifecycle, specifically focusing on the TSR use case of autonomous vehicles. To ensure accuracy and relevance, we have sought feedback from industry professionals involved in the development of AI technologies for autonomous vehicles. 

This is an early draft of the profile and your feedback is highly appreciated.
